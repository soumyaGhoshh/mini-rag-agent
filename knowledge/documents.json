Key features include automatic API documentation (Swagger UI), validation using Pydantic, and asynchronous support. It is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.",

Unlike traditional databases that search for exact matches, vector databases find data that is semantically similar. Common vector databases include Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, and Chroma.

    "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) responses by retrieving relevant data from an external knowledge base before generating an answer. This reduces hallucinations and allows the model to answer questions about private or up-to-date data not present in its training set.",

    "content": "FastAPI is generally faster than Flask due to its asynchronous capabilities and Starlette foundation. FastAPI includes built-in data validation and documentation, whereas Flask is more minimal and requires extensions for these features. Flask is often easier for beginners due to its simplicity, but FastAPI is preferred for modern, high-performance APIs.",
